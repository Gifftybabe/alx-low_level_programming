An introductory README file on C - Singly linked lists.
###
What is Linked List in C?
A Linked List is a linear data structure. Every linked list has two parts, the data section and the address section that holds the address of the next element in the list, which is called a node.
##
The size of the linked list is not fixed, and data items can be added at any locations in the list. The disadvantage is that to get to a node, we must traverse to all the way from the first node to the node that we require. The Linked List is like an array but unlike an array, it is not stored sequentially in the memory.
_____
In the structure, we have a data variable called info to hold data and a pointer variable to point at the address. There are various operations that can be done on a linked list, like:

create()
display()
insert_begin()
insert_end()
]insert_pos()
delete_begin()
delete_end()
delete_pos()
