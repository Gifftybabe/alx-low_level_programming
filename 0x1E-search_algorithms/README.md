Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array.

In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array.

Binary search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items. If the elements are not sorted already, we need to sort them first.


Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in two ways which are discussed below.
### Recursive Method
The recursive method follows the divide and conquer approach.

binarySearch(arr, x, low, high)
    if low > high
        return False 
    else
        mid = (low + high) / 2 
        if x == arr[mid]
            return mid
        else if x > arr[mid]        // x is on the right side
            return binarySearch(arr, x, mid + 1, high)
        else                               // x is on the left side
            return binarySearch(arr, x, low, mid - 1)

### Iterative Method

do until the pointers low and high meet each other.
    mid = (low + high)/2
    if (x == arr[mid])
        return mid
    else if (x > arr[mid]) // x is on the right side
        low = mid + 1
    else                       // x is on the left side
        high = mid - 1
