Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array.

In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array.

Binary search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items. If the elements are not sorted already, we need to sort them first.


Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in two ways which are discussed below.
- Recursive Method
- Iterative Method
