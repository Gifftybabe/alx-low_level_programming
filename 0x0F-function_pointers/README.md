A pointer is a memory address
giving...
______int *foo_ptr = &foo;
______
####
The obvious way to declare two pointer variables in a single declaration is:
____int* ptr_a, ptr_b;
###
With general objectives:
What are function pointers and how to use them
What does a function pointer exactly hold
Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory
